<h1>Odin Recipes</h1>
<p>In this assignment for The Odin Project, I am practicing my use of basic HTML. Specifically, this assignment is intended to demonstrate a basic understanding of HTML boilerplate, headers, lists, and simple text-level semantic elements.</p>
<p>This project also provided me with an opportunity to begin using Git and Github for the first time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>More recently, I have also used this project to practice very basic CSS.</p>
